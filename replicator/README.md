# Replicator

This first instance of ArtBox was created by Lafe, contact me at lafelabs@gmail.com to get more information on copying all this.  I can come meet if you're in the DC/Baltimore metro area, otherwise I can email and skype as needed to clone this technology.

If you clone this, you should change this file to add your information to help spread the technology to the next person, tell them to modify it yet again, etc.  This *whole* thing is replicating, including the replicator, with no implied connection back to the original author.

To replicate ArtBox itself, you should just follow the instructions in a factory, which is a place that has the media all set up to replicate the whole thing, with feedstock, tools, and media to describe fabrication.

To replicate the factory, copy the media panels described here. An existing factory should have physical media panels with the various parts of information needed, which should be photographed and uploaded to the uploaded images in this page.  They are as follows:
