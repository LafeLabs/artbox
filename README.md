# ArtBox

ArtBox, self replicating box to carry around art supplies.

To create a Web instance of this self-replicating media, create a new directory on the Web and put the file replicator_artbox.php in it. Then navigate a browser to your web address and click on the php program to run it.  This will replicate all the components of this system which do not have separate replicators.  All this is part of the Geometron organic media system.  This instance, the documentation of the ArtBox, consists of a map, four things below it, a symbol factory in the directory symbol, and saved symbols in the directory symbols/.  

After the main replicator is run, click down into the four directories and the symbol factory and run all 5 replicators to generate the scroll readers and editors.  Then navigate up to the map and click on the elements to get the information you need to gather the physical tools and feedstock and start fabricating physical ArtBoxes.

To replicate the entire system, click on replicator, follow the instructions to replicate all parts. Also replicator/ has contact info for previous people who have worked on this who can help you replicate.
